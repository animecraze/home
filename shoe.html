					   <h1 id="Top"> Video Games! </h1>
					    
                       <p> So, what kinds of video games are there, really? Well, to list a few...
					      <ul>
						     <li>Action</li>
							 <li>Role-playing Games (RPG)</li>
							 <li> Adventure</li>
							 <li> Sports</li>
							 <li> Horror</li>
						  </ul>
					   </p>
					    <p>
						   Those are just a few of the many genres of video games.
						   There are also different types of games based on the console.
						   For example: The formatting would be different because of the screen. 
						   If the screen is smaller, naturally the game would have to be made to fit the screen of the console.
                        </p>
						<h2> Plot </h2>
						<p> Before you start to do anything, you should stop and think about the plot.
						    What will it be about? Who will be in it? Those are the kind of questions you should ask yourself.
							Plots are not just for video games, obviously. 
							Writers need to use plots to write a successful story, and game developers need to use plots to program a succesful game.
							The developers cannot just aimlessly program without knowing what to do. 
							A plot that is made on the spot, wouldn&rsquo;t be as interesting as a plot that had been given much thought.
					    </p>
						<h2> Characters </h2>
						<p> Of course, character design is an essential element in creating a video game.
                            After the plot has been finished, the characters plug themselves in their role of the plot.						
						    Many of us like to customize our own character based on our interests. 
							When the game does not include character customization, it&rsquo;s important to make the player look eye-catching, so people would be more satisfied.
							The player, usually having a sidekick or a party by their side, goes of to adventure.
							The side characters make the game more interesting and helpful, as they would idealy give tips and tricks to the player along the way.
							In the case of clichés, the protagonist would probably have one goal, and as they are trying to achieve it, many sidequests would appear for the player to finish before they can move on to their original quest.
                       </p>
					   <h2> Programming </h2>
					   <p> After the plot has been settled and the characters have been finalized, the programming comes in. 
					       The coding, and all of that hard stuff is probably the most demotivational part.
						   You have to write/type codes over and over again, until it really ticks you off. 
						   Of course, it's fun to see the things you have programmed into action, but before you do that, you need to spend a lot of time writing the code.
						   In fact, people spend so many hours just redrawing a character just to make them walk! 
						   The way their clothes move, and the way their body moves all need to be incorporated into the animation. 
						   The programming of video games kind of remind me of the designing of a website just like this one. 
						   You see, In order for a website to be eye-catching, you need to be able to format and code in a more advanced way.
						   I'm not saying my website is advanced (because it isn&rsquo;t), but websites that look good have way more coding than websites with lesser appeal. 
						   It's the same with video games, but theres more time and effort that is needed to be invested.
					   </p>
					   <h2> Final </h2>
					   <p> So, you're done programming, and all of that jazz. What's next? How about a test-drive? 
					       Yep, it's time to get cozy on that couch, and admire all the hard work that you put in by playing the game.
						   Of course, there are "official testers", but, who wouldn't want to play their own game?
						   After the testing&rsquo;s been done, it's time to manufacture and sell the game.
						   The more well-known you are, the higher the chances of selling out. 
						   Of course, if you're just starting out, you need to make a name for yourself.
						   Advertise, advertise, advertise!
						   So you've come to end of your quest, huh?
						   Nope. Now that you attracted some fans, it's time to start the process all over again! 
						   Get cracking!
